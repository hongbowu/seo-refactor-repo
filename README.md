Horiseon Webpage is a platform that offers high-quality customer services, including search engine optimization (SEO), online reputation management, social media marketing, and more.

## User Story
As a web developer, I have optimized the Horiseon Webpage to enhance the reading experience on tablets. The goal is to ensure that users logging into the site can easily read content without encountering display issues. The specific changes made include:

Adjustments for screen sizes at 1029px and 768px.
Font size modifications in different sections to prevent text from leaving the frame during resizing.

Frame size adjustments to maintain a balanced layout, avoiding overcrowding or sparse appearance.

1.Optimization for tablet reading at both 1029px and 768px screen sizes.
